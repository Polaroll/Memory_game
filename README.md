# Overview

[Memory Game](https://polaroll.github.io/Memory_game/)

The memory game is a grid of squares that start off only lighting up a few squares for a second or two before going dark again. The point of the game is to click all the squares that lit up and not the ones that stayed dark. If done correctly, then more squares will light up for the next round until eventually it gets too hard to memorize every square that lit up.

I wrote this software to learn more about the JavaScript programming language, as well as learn how to better use html. This was a fun way to challenge myself to learn more about coding on a website.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used GitHub to hold update my code. I also used a javascript validator called Code Beautify to ensure that my code did not have any errors or incorrect syntax.

I used the JavaScript programming language, an object-oriented programming language that makes web pages interactive.

# Useful Websites

- [Mdn Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [Code Beautify](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate)

# Future Work

- Disable being able to click on squares before the highlited squares go dark again.
- Being able to reset the game without reloading the page.
- Add a description of the game and how it works.
- Create a 'Game over' screen when the lives count reaches 0.
- Add a highscore or leaderboard system.
